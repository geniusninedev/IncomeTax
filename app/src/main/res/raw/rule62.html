Income from the manufacture of rubber<br />
<br />
[(1) Income derived from the sale of centrifuged latex or cenex or latex based 
crepes (such as pale latex crepe) or brown crepes (such as estate brown crepe, 
remilled crepe, smoked blanket crepe or flat bark crepe) or technically 
specified block rubbers manufactured or processed from field latex or coagulum 
obtained from rubber plants grown by the seller in India shall be computed as if 
it were income derived from business, and thirty-five per cent of such income 
shall be deemed to be income liable to tax.]<br />
<br />
(2) In computing such income, an allowance shall be made in respect of the cost 
of planting rubber plants in replacement of plants that have died or become 
permanently useless in an area already planted, if such area has not previously 
been abandoned, and for the purpose of determining such cost, no deduction shall 
be made in respect of the amount of any subsidy which, under the provisions of 
clause (31) of section 10, is not includible in the total income.</p>
