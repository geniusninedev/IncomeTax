<br />
(1) Where in respect of an international transaction or a specified domestic 
transaction, the application of the most appropriate method referred to in 
sub-section (1) of section 92C results in determination of more than one price, 
then the arm's length price in respect of such international transaction or 
specified domestic transaction shall be computed in accordance with the 
provisions of this rule.<br />
<br />
(2) A dataset shall be constructed by placing the prices referred to in sub-rule 
(1) in an ascending order and the arm's length price shall be determined on the 
basis of the dataset so constructed:<br />
<br />
Provided that in a case referred to in clause (i) of sub-rule (5) of rule 10B, 
where the comparable uncontrolled transaction has been identified on the basis 
of data relating to the current year and the enterprise undertaking the said 
uncontrolled transaction, [not being the enterprise undertaking the 
international transaction or the specified domestic transaction referred to in 
sub-rule (1)], has in either or both of the two financial years immediately 
preceding the current year undertaken the same or similar comparable 
uncontrolled transaction then,—<br />
<br />
(i) the most appropriate method used to determine the price of the comparable 
uncontrolled transaction or transactions undertaken in the aforesaid period and 
the price in respect of such uncontrolled transactions shall be determined; and<br />
<br />
(ii) the weighted average of the prices, computed in accordance with the manner 
provided in sub-rule (3), of the comparable uncontrolled transactions undertaken 
in the current year and in the aforesaid period preceding it shall be included 
in the dataset instead of the price referred to in sub-rule (1):<br />
<br />
Provided further that in a case referred to in clause (ii) of sub-rule (5) of 
rule 10B, where the comparable uncontrolled transaction has been identified on 
the basis of the data relating to the financial year immediately preceding the 
current year and the enterprise undertaking the said uncontrolled transaction, 
[not being the enterprise undertaking the international transaction or the 
specified domestic transaction referred to in sub-rule (1)], has in the 
financial year immediately preceding the said financial year undertaken the same 
or similar comparable uncontrolled transaction then,—<br />
<br />
(i) the price in respect of such uncontrolled transaction shall be determined by 
applying the most appropriate method in a similar manner as it was applied to 
determine the price of the comparable uncontrolled transaction undertaken in the 
financial year immediately preceding the current year; and<br />
<br />
(ii) the weighted average of the prices, computed in accordance with the manner 
provided in sub-rule (3), of the comparable uncontrolled transactions undertaken 
in the aforesaid period of two years shall be included in the dataset instead of 
the price referred to in sub-rule (1) :<br />
<br />
Provided also that where the use of data relating to the current year in terms 
of the proviso to sub-rule (5) of rule 10B establishes that,—<br />
<br />
(i) the enterprise has not undertaken same or similar uncontrolled transaction 
during the current year; or<br />
<br />
(ii) the uncontrolled transaction undertaken by an enterprise in the current 
year is not a comparable uncontrolled transaction,<br />
<br />
then, irrespective of the fact that such an enterprise had undertaken comparable 
uncontrolled transaction in the financial year immediately preceding the current 
year or the financial year immediately preceding such financial year, the price 
of comparable uncontrolled transaction or the weighted average of the prices of 
the uncontrolled transactions, as the case may be, undertaken by such enterprise 
shall not be included in the dataset.<br />
<br />
(3) Where an enterprise has undertaken comparable uncontrolled transactions in 
more than one financial year, then for the purposes of sub-rule (2) the weighted 
average of the prices of such transactions shall be computed in the following 
manner, namely:—<br />
<br />
(i) where the prices have been determined using the method referred to in clause 
(b) of sub-rule (1) of rule 10B, the weighted average of the prices shall be 
computed with weights being assigned to the quantum of sales which has been 
considered for arriving at the respective prices;<br />
<br />
(ii) where the prices have been determined using the method referred to in 
clause (c) of sub-rule (1) of rule 10B, the weighted average of the prices shall 
be computed with weights being assigned to the quantum of costs which has been 
considered for arriving at the respective prices;<br />
<br />
(iii) where the prices have been determined using the method referred to in 
clause (e) of sub- rule (1) of rule 10B, the weighted average of the prices 
shall be computed with weights being assigned to the quantum of costs incurred 
or sales effected or assets employed or to be employed, or as the case may be, 
any other base which has been considered for arriving at the respective prices.<br />
<br />
(4) Where the most appropriate method applied is a method other than the method 
referred to in clause (d) or clause (f) of sub-section (1) of section 92C and 
the dataset constructed in accordance with sub-rule (2) consists of six or more 
entries, an arm's length range beginning from the thirty-fifth percentile of the 
dataset and ending on the sixty-fifth percentile of the dataset shall be 
constructed and the arm's length price shall be computed in accordance with 
sub-rule (5) and sub-rule (6).<br />
<br />
(5) If the price at which the international transaction or the specified 
domestic transaction has actually been undertaken is within the range referred 
to in sub-rule (4), then, the price at which such international transaction or 
the specified domestic transaction has actually been undertaken shall be deemed 
to be the arm's length price.<br />
<br />
(6) If the price at which the international transaction or the specified 
domestic transaction has actually been undertaken is outside the arm's length 
range referred to in sub-rule (4), the arm's length price shall be taken to be 
the median of the dataset.<br />
<br />
(7) In a case where the provisions of sub-rule (4) are not applicable, the arm's 
length price shall be the arithmetical mean of all the values included in the 
dataset:<br />
<br />
Provided that, if the variation between the arm's length price so determined and 
price at which the international transaction or specified domestic transaction 
has actually been undertaken does not exceed such percentage not exceeding three 
per cent of the latter, as may be notified by the Central Government in the 
Official Gazette in this behalf, the price at which the international 
transaction or specified domestic transaction has actually been undertaken shall 
be deemed to be the arm's length price.<br />
<br />
(8) For the purposes of this rule,—<br />
<br />
(a) "the thirty-fifth percentile" of a dataset, having values arranged in an 
ascending order, shall be the lowest value in the dataset such that at least 
thirty five per cent of the values included in the dataset are equal to or less 
than such value:<br />
Provided that, if the number of values that are equal to or less than the 
aforesaid value is a whole number, then the thirty-fifth percentile shall be the 
arithmetic mean of such value and the value immediately succeeding it in the 
dataset;<br />
<br />
(b) "the sixty-fifth percentile" of a dataset, having values arranged in an 
ascending order, shall be the lowest value in the dataset such that at least 
sixty five per cent of the values included in the dataset are equal to or less 
than such value:<br />
Provided that, if the number of values that are equal to or less than the 
aforesaid value is a whole number, then the sixty-fifth percentile shall be the 
arithmetic mean of such value and the value immediately succeeding it in the 
dataset;<br />
<br />
(c) "the median" of the dataset, having values arranged in an ascending order, 
shall be the lowest value in the dataset such that at least fifty per cent of 
the values included in the dataset are equal to or less than such value:<br />
Provided that, if the number of values that are equal to or less than the 
aforesaid value is a whole number, then the median shall be the arithmetic mean 
of such value and the value immediately succeeding it in the dataset.</p>
