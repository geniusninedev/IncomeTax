<br />
[Procedure.<br />
<br />
<strong>10TE</strong>. (1) For the purposes of exercise of the option for safe 
harbour, the assessee shall furnish a Form 3CEFA, complete in all respects, to 
the Assessing Officer on or before the due date specified in Explanation 2 below 
sub-section (1) of section 139 for furnishing the return of income for—<br />
<br />
(i) the relevant assessment year, in case the option is exercised only for that 
assessment year; or<br />
<br />
(ii) the first of the assessment years, in case the option is exercised for more 
than one assessment year:<br />
<br />
Provided that the return of income for the relevant assessment year or the first 
of the relevant assessment years, as the case may be, is furnished by the 
assessee on or before the date of furnishing of Form 3CEFA.<br />
<br />
(2) The option for safe harbour validly exercised shall continue to remain in 
force for the period specified in Form 3CEFA or a period of five years whichever 
is less:<br />
<br />
Provided that the assessee shall, in respect of the assessment year or years 
following the initial assessment year, furnish a statement to the Assessing 
Officer before furnishing return of income of that year, providing details of 
eligible transactions, their quantum and the profit margins or the rate of 
interest or commission shown:<br />
<br />
Provided further that an option for safe harbour shall not remain in force in 
respect of any assessment year following the initial assessment year, if—<br />
<br />
(i) the option is held to be invalid for the relevant assessment year by the 
Transfer Pricing Officer under sub-rule (11) or by the Commissioner under 
sub-rule (8) in respect of an objection filed by the assessee against the order 
of the Transfer Pricing Officer under sub-rule (11), as the case may be; or<br />
<br />
(ii) the eligible assessee opts out of the safe harbour, for the relevant 
assessment year, by furnishing a declaration to that effect, to the Assessing 
Officer.<br />
<br />
(3) On receipt of Form 3CEFA, the Assessing Officer shall verify whether—<br />
<br />
(i) the assessee exercising the option is an eligible assessee; and<br />
<br />
(ii) the transaction in respect of which the option is exercised is an eligible 
international transaction,<br />
<br />
before the option for safe harbour by the assessee is treated to be validly 
exercised.<br />
<br />
(4) Where the Assessing officer doubts the valid exercise of the option for the 
safe harbour by an assessee, he shall make a reference to the Transfer Pricing 
Officer for determination of the eligibility of the assessee or the 
international transaction or both for the purposes of the safe harbour.<br />
<br />
(5) For the purposes of sub-rule (4) and sub-rule (10), the Transfer Pricing 
Officer may require the assessee, by notice in writing, to furnish such 
information or documents or other evidence as he may consider necessary, and the 
assessee shall furnish the same within the time specified in such notice.<br />
<br />
(6) Where—<br />
<br />
(a) the assessee does not furnish the information or documents or other evidence 
required by the Transfer Pricing Officer; or<br />
<br />
(b) the Transfer Pricing Officer finds that the assessee is not an eligible 
assessee; or<br />
<br />
(c) the Transfer Pricing Officer finds that the international transaction in 
respect of which the option referred to in sub-rule (1) has been exercised is 
not an eligible international transaction,<br />
<br />
the Transfer Pricing Officer shall, by order in writing, declare the option 
exercised by the assessee under sub-rule (1) to be invalid and cause a copy of 
the said order to be served on the assessee and the Assessing Officer:<br />
<br />
Provided that no order declaring the option exercised by the assessee to be 
invalid shall be passed without giving an opportunity of being heard to the 
assessee.<br />
<br />
(7) If the assessee objects to the order of the Transfer Pricing Officer under 
sub-rule (6) or sub-rule (11) declaring the option to be invalid, he may file 
his objections with the Commissioner, to whom the Transfer Pricing Officer is 
subordinate, within fifteen days of receipt of the order of the Transfer Pricing 
Officer.<br />
<br />
(8) On receipt of the objection referred to in sub-rule (7), the Commissioner 
shall after providing an opportunity of being heard to the assessee pass 
appropriate orders in respect of the validity or otherwise of the option 
exercised by the assessee and cause a copy of the said order to be served on the 
assessee and the Assessing Officer.<br />
<br />
(9) In a case where option exercised by the assessee has been held to be valid, 
the Assessing officer shall proceed to verify whether the transfer price 
declared by the assessee in respect of the relevant eligible international 
transactions is in accordance with the circumstances specified in sub-rule (2) 
of rule 10 TD and, if it is not in accordance with the said circumstances, the 
Assessing Officer shall adopt the operating profit margin or rate of interest or 
commission specified in sub-rule (2) of rule 10TD.<br />
<br />
(10) Where the facts and circumstances on the basis of which the option 
exercised by the assessee was held to be valid have changed and the Assessing 
Officer has reason to doubt the eligibility of an assessee or the international 
transaction for any assessment year other than the initial Assessment Year 
falling within the period for which the option was exercised by the assessee, he 
shall make a reference to the Transfer Pricing Officer for determination of 
eligibility of the assessee or the international transaction or both for the 
purpose of safe harbour.<br />
<br />
<strong>Explanation.—</strong><br />
<br />
For purposes of this sub-rule the facts and circumstances include:—<br />
<br />
(a) functional profile of the assessee in respect of the international 
transaction;<br />
<br />
(b) the risks being undertaken by the assessee;<br />
<br />
(c) the substantive contractual conditions governing the role of the assessee in 
respect of the international transaction;<br />
<br />
(d) the conduct of the assessee as referred to in sub-rule (2) or sub-rule (3) 
of rule 10TB; or<br />
<br />
(e) the substantive nature of the international transaction.<br />
<br />
(11) The Transfer Pricing Officer on receipt of a reference under sub-rule (10) 
shall, by an order in writing, determine the validity or otherwise of the option 
exercised by the assessee for the relevant year after providing an opportunity 
of being heard to the assessee and cause a copy of the said order to be served 
on the assessee and the Assessing Officer.<br />
<br />
(12) Nothing contained in this rule shall affect the power of the Assessing 
Officer to make a reference under section 92CA in respect of international 
transaction other than the eligible international transaction.<br />
<br />
(13) Where no option for safe harbour has been exercised under sub-rule (1) by 
an eligible assessee in respect of an eligible international transaction entered 
into by the assessee or the option exercised by the assessee is held to be 
invalid, the arm's length price in relation to such international transaction 
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of sections 92C and 92CA 
without having regard to the profit margin or the rate of interest or commission 
as specified in sub-rule (2) of rule 10TD.<br />
<br />
(14) For the purposes of this rule,—<br />
<br />
(i) no reference under sub-rule(4) shall be made by an Assessing Officer after 
expiry of a period of two months from the end of the month in which Form 3CEFA 
is received by him;<br />
<br />
(ii) no order under sub-rule (6) or sub-rule (11) shall be passed by the 
Transfer Pricing Officer after expiry of a period of two months from the end of 
the month in which the reference from the Assessing officer under sub-rule(4) or 
sub-rule (10), as the case may be, is received by him;<br />
<br />
(iii) the order under sub-rule (8) shall be passed by the Commissioner within a 
period of two months from the end of the month in which the objection filed by 
the assessee under sub-rule (7) is received by him.<br />
<br />
(15) If the Assessing Officer or the Transfer Pricing Officer or the 
Commissioner, as the case may be, does not make a reference or pass an order, as 
the case may be, within the time specified in sub-rule (14), then the option for 
safe harbour exercised by the assessee shall be treated as valid.]</p>
