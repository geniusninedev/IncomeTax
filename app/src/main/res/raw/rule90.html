<br />
(2) The agreement shall contain rollback provision in respect of an 
international transaction subject to the following, namely:—<br />
<br />
(i) the international transaction is same as the international transaction to 
which the agreement (other than the rollback provision) applies;<br />

which the said international transaction has been undertaken by the applicant; 
and<br />
<br />
(v) the applicant has made an application seeking rollback in Form 3CEDA in 
accordance with sub-rule (5);<br />
<br />
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rule (2), rollback provision shall 
not be provided in respect of an international transaction for a rollback year, 
if,—<br />
<br />
(i) the determination of arm's length price of the said international 
transaction for the said year has been subject matter of an appeal before the

in the return of income of the said year.<br />
<br />
(4) Where the rollback provision specifies the manner in which arm's length 
price shall be determined in relation to an international transaction undertaken

been agreed to be provided for determination of arm's length price of the same 
international transaction to be undertaken in any previous year to which the 
agreement applies, not being a rollback year.<br />
