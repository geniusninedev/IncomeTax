<br />
8C. For the purposes of clause (iiia) of sub-section (1) of section 36, the pro 
rata amount of discount on a zero coupon bond shall be computed in the following 
manner, namely:—<br />
<br />
(a) the period of life of the bond shall be converted into number of calendar 
months and, for this purpose, where the calendar month in which the bond is 
issued or the bond matures or is redeemed contains a part of a calendar month 
then, if such part is fifteen days or more than fifteen days, it shall be 
increased to one calendar month and if such part is less than fifteen days it 
shall be ignored;<br />
<br />
(b) the amount of discount shall be divided by the number of calendar months 
determined in accordance with clause (a);<br />
<br />
(c) where one or more than one calendar month out of calendar months determined 
in accordance with clause (a) is or are included in a previous year, the amount 
determined in accordance with clause (b) shall be multiplied by the number of 
calendar months so included and the amount so arrived at shall be taken to be 
the pro rata amount of discount for that previous year.]</p>
