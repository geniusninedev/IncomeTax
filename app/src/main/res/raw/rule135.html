Procedure before the National Committee.<br />
<br />
<strong>11M</strong>.(1) All applications under rule 11L should be circulated by 
the Secretary to the National Committee to all the members of the Committee and 
will be considered by the National Committee at its sitting held at least seven 
days after the date on which the application is circulated. In exceptional 
cases, the Chairman may curtail the period of notice and may also direct 
consideration of the application by circulation only.<br />
<br />
(2) The National Committee may call for such other information from the 
applicant as it deems necessary for taking a decision on the application and may 
also direct its Secretary to make or cause to be made enquiries on any matter 
relating to the application.<br />
<br />
(3) The quorum for taking a decision on an application shall be at least five 
members, including Chairman. If a meeting is adjourned without taking a decision 
for lack of quorum, the 90[decision to adjourn the meeting] may be taken by the 
members present, even without the requisite quorum. 91[This decision would be 
conveyed to the absentee members along with notice about the date, time and 
place for re-holding the adjourned meeting.]<br />
<br />
(4) Approval of an association or institution shall be for such period as the 
National Committee may decide, generally not exceeding a period of three years 
at a time. Subsequent approvals, if required, for a further period, can be 
granted only if the National Committee is satisfied about the activities of the 
association or institution during the preceding period of approval.<br />
<br />
(5) The National Committee shall recommend ordinarily to the Central Government 
a project or scheme for being notified as an eligible project or scheme for an 
initial period up to three financial years. If the project or scheme is likely 
to extend beyond three financial years, the National Committee shall make 
further recommendations for a period of three years at a time after being 
satisfied that the project or, as the case may be, scheme is being executed 
properly. For this purpose, the National Committee may monitor the execution of 
project or scheme and call for such information as it deems necessary.</p>
