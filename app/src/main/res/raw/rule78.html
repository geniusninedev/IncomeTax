Most appropriate method.<br />
<br />
(1) For the purposes of sub-section (1) of section 92C, the most appropriate 
method shall be the method which is best suited to the facts and circumstances 
of each particular international transaction 56a[or specified domestic 
transaction], and which provides the most reliable measure of an arm's length 
price in relation to the international transaction 56a[or the specified domestic 
transaction, as the case may be].<br />
<br />
(2) In selecting the most appropriate method as specified in sub-rule (1), the 
following factors shall be taken into account, namely:—<br />
<br />
(a) the nature and class of the international transaction 56a[or the specified 
domestic transaction];<br />
<br />
(b) the class or classes of associated enterprises entering into the transaction 
and the functions performed by them taking into account assets employed or to be 
employed and risks assumed by such enterprises;<br />
<br />
(c) the availability, coverage and reliability of data necessary for application 
of the method;<br />
<br />
(d) the degree of comparability existing between the international transaction 
56a[or the specified domestic transaction] and the uncontrolled transaction and 
between the enterprises entering into such transactions;<br />
<br />
(e) the extent to which reliable and accurate adjustments can be made to account 
for differences, if any, between the international transaction 56a[or the 
specified domestic transaction] and the comparable uncontrolled transaction or 
between the enterprises entering into such transactions;<br />
<br />
(f) the nature, extent and reliability of assumptions required to be made in 
application of a method.</p>
