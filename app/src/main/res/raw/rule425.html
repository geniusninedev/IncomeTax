<br />
[Foreign Tax Credit.<br />
<br />
<strong>128</strong>. (1) An assessee, being a resident shall be allowed a 
credit for the amount of any foreign tax paid by him in a country or specified 
territory outside India, by way of deduction or otherwise, in the year in which 
the income corresponding to such tax has been offered to tax or assessed to tax 
in India, in the manner and to the extent as specified in this rule :<br />
<br />
Provided that in a case where income on which foreign tax has been paid or 
deducted, is offered to tax in more than one year, credit of foreign tax shall 
be allowed across those years in the same proportion in which the income is 
offered to tax or assessed to tax in India.<br />
<br />
(2) The foreign tax referred to in sub-rule (1) shall mean,—<br />
<br />
(a) in respect of a country or specified territory outside India with which 
India has entered into an agreement for the relief or avoidance of double 
taxation of income in terms of section 90 or section 90A, the tax covered under 
the said agreement;<br />
<br />
(b) in respect of any other country or specified territory outside India, the 
tax payable under the law in force in that country or specified territory in the 
nature of income-tax referred to in clause (iv) of the Explanation to section 
91.<br />
<br />
(3) The credit under sub-rule (1) shall be available against the amount of tax, 
surcharge and cess payable under the Act but not in respect of any sum payable 
by way of interest, fee or penalty.<br />
<br />
(4) No credit under sub-rule (1) shall be available in respect of any amount of 
foreign tax or part thereof which is disputed in any manner by the assessee:<br />
<br />
Provided that the credit of such disputed tax shall be allowed for the year in 
which such income is offered to tax or assessed to tax in India if the assessee 
within six months from the end of the month in which the dispute is finally 
settled, furnishes evidence of settlement of dispute and an evidence to the 
effect that the liability for payment of such foreign tax has been discharged by 
him and furnishes an undertaking that no refund in respect of such amount has 
directly or indirectly been claimed or shall be claimed.<br />
<br />
(5) The credit of foreign tax shall be the aggregate of the amounts of credit 
computed separately for each source of income arising from a particular country 
or specified territory outside India and shall be given effect to in the 
following manner:—<br />
<br />
(i) the credit shall be the lower of the tax payable under the Act on such 
income and the foreign paid on such income :<br />
<br />
Provided that where the foreign tax paid exceeds the amount of tax payable in 
accordance with the provisions of the agreement for relief or avoidance of 
double taxation, such excess shall be ignored for the purposes of this clause;<br />
<br />
(ii) the credit shall be determined by conversion of the currency of payment of 
foreign tax at the telegraphic transfer buying rate on the last day of the month 
immediately preceding the month in which such tax has been paid or deducted.<br />
<br />
(6) In a case where any tax is payable under the provisions of section 115JB or 
section 115JC, the credit of foreign tax shall be allowed against such tax in 
the same manner as is allowable against any tax payable under the provisions of 
the Act other than the provisions of the said sections (hereafter referred to as 
the "normal provisions").<br />
<br />
(7) Where the amount of foreign tax credit available against the tax payable 
under the provisions of section 115JB or section 115JC exceeds the amount of tax 
credit available against the normal provisions, then while computing the amount 
of credit under section 115JAA or section 115JD in respect of the taxes paid 
under section 115JB or section 115JC, as the case may be, such excess shall be 
ignored.<br />
<br />
(8) Credit of any foreign tax shall be allowed on furnishing the following 
documents by the assessee, namely:—<br />
<br />
(i) a statement of income from the country or specified territory outside India 
offered for tax for the previous year and of foreign tax deducted or paid on 
such income in Form No.67 and verified in the manner specified therein;<br />
<br />
(ii) certificate or statement specifying the nature of income and the amount of 
tax deducted therefrom or paid by the assessee,—<br />
<br />
(a) from the tax authority of the country or the specified territory outside 
India; or<br />
<br />
(b) from the person responsible for deduction of such tax; or<br />
<br />
(c) signed by the assessee:<br />
<br />
Provided that the statement furnished by the assessee in clause (c) shall be 
valid if it is accompanied by,—<br />
<br />
(A) an acknowledgement of online payment or bank counter foil or challan for 
payment of tax where the payment has been made by the assessee;<br />
<br />
(B) proof of deduction where the tax has been deducted.<br />
<br />
(9) The statement in Form No.67 referred to in clause (i) of sub-rule (8) and 
the certificate or the statement referred to in clause (ii) of sub-rule (8) 
shall be furnished on or before the due date specified for furnishing the return 
of income under sub-section (1) of section 139, in the manner specified for 
furnishing such return of income.<br />
<br />
(10) Form No.67 shall also be furnished in a case where the carry backward of 
loss of the current year results in refund of foreign tax for which credit has 
been claimed in any earlier previous year or years.<br />
<br />
