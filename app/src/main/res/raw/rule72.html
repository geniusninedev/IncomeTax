[44Deduction in respect of expenditure on acquisition of distribution rights of 
feature films.<br />
<br />
(1) In computing the profits and gains of the business of distribution of 
feature films carried on by a person (the person carrying on such business 
hereafter in this rule referred to as film distributor), the deduction in 
respect of the cost of acquisition of a feature film shall be allowed in 
accordance with sub-rule (2) to sub-rule (4).<br />
<br />
<strong>Explanation :</strong> <br />
<br />
For the purposes of this rule, “cost of acquisition”, in relation to a feature 
film, means the amount paid [by the film distributor to the film producer or to 
another distributor under an agreement entered into by the film distributor with 
such film producer or such other distributor, as the case may be] for acquiring 
the rights of exhibition and, where the rights of exhibition have been acquired 
on a minimum guarantee basis, the minimum amount guaranteed, not being—<br />
<br />
(i) the amount of expenditure incurred by the film distributor for the 
preparation of the positive prints of the film; and<br />
<br />
(ii) the expenditure incurred by him in connection with the advertisement of the 
film.<br />
<br />
(2) Where a feature film is acquired by the film distributor in any previous 
year and in such previous year—<br />
<br />
(a) the film distributor sells all rights of exhibition of the film, the entire 
cost of acquisition of the film shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the 
profits and gains of such previous year; or<br />
<br />
(b) the film distributor,—<br />
<br />
(i) himself exhibits the film on a commercial basis in all or some of the areas; 
or<br />
<br />
(ii) sells the rights of exhibition of the film in respect of some of the areas; 
or<br />
<br />
(iii) himself exhibits the film on a commercial basis in certain areas and sells 
the rights of exhibition of the film in respect of all or some of the remaining 
areas,<br />
<br />
and the film is released for exhibition on a commercial basis at least 
46[ninety] days before the end of such previous year, the entire cost of 
acquisition of the film shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the profits 
and gains of such previous year.<br />
<br />
(3) Where a feature film is acquired by the film distributor in any previous 
year and in such previous year the film distributor—<br />
<br />
(a) himself exhibits the film on a commercial basis in all or some of the areas; 
or<br />
<br />
(b) sells the rights of exhibition of the film in respect of some of the areas; 
or<br />
<br />
(c) himself exhibits the film on a commercial basis in certain areas and sells 
the rights of exhibition of the film in respect of all or some of the remaining 
areas,and the film is not released for exhibition on a commercial basis at least 
46[ninety] days before the end of such previous year, the cost of acquisition of 
the film in so far as it does not exceed the amount realised by the film 
distributor by exhibiting the film on a commercial basis or the amount for which 
the rights of exhibition have been sold or, as the case may be, the aggregate of 
the amounts realised by the film distributor by exhibiting the film and by the 
sale of the rights of exhibition, shall be allowed as a deduction in computing 
the profits and gains of such previous year; and the balance, if any, shall be 
carried forward to the next following previous year and allowed as a deduction 
in that year.<br />
<br />
(4) Where during the previous year in which a feature film is acquired by the 
film distributor, he does not himself exhibit the film on a commercial basis or 
does not sell the rights of exhibition of the film, no deduction shall be 
allowed in respect of the cost of acquisition of the film in computing the 
profits and gains of such previous year; and the entire cost of acquisition 
shall be carried forward to the next following previous year and allowed as a 
deduction in that year.<br />
<br />
(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this rule, 
the deduction under this rule shall not be allowed unless—<br />
<br />
(a) in a case where the film distributor,—<br />
<br />
(i) has himself exhibited the feature film on a commercial basis; or<br />
<br />
(ii) has sold the rights of exhibition of the feature film; or<br />
<br />
(iii) has himself exhibited the feature film on a commercial basis in some areas 
and has sold the rights of exhibition of the feature film in respect of all or 
some of the remaining areas,<br />
<br />
the amount realised by exhibiting the film, or the amount for which the rights 
of exhibition have been sold, or, as the case may be, the aggregate of such 
amounts, is credited in the books of account maintained by him in respect of the 
year in which the deduction is admissible ;<br />
<br />
(b) in a case where the film distributor has transferred the rights of 
exhibition of the feature film on a minimum guarantee basis, the minimum amount 
guaranteed and the amount, if any, received or due in excess of the guaranteed 
amount, or where the film distributor follows cash system of accounting, the 
amount received towards the minimum guarantee and the amount, if any, received 
in excess of the guaranteed amount, are credited in the books of account 
maintained by him in respect of the year in which the deduction is admissible.<br />
<br />
(6) For the purposes of this rule,—<br />
<br />
(i) the sale of the rights of exhibition of a feature film includes the lease of 
such rights or their transfer on a minimum guarantee basis ;<br />
<br />
(ii) the rights of exhibition of a feature film shall be deemed to have been 
sold only on the date when the positive prints of the film are delivered by the 
film distributor to the purchaser of such rights ;<br />
<br />
[(iii) distributor shall include a sub-distributor.]<br />
<br />
[(7) Nothing contained in this rule shall apply in relation to any assessment 
year commencing before the 1st day of April, 1987.]</p>
